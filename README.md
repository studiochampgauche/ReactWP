# What is ReactWP?

ReactWP is a modern boilerplate for building full React-based themes inside WordPress, without going headless.

It’s designed for developers who want to keep the flexibility of WordPress (themes, admin, plugins, SEO, server rendering) while using modern JavaScript tools like React, JSX, Webpack, hot reloading, and components.

Instead of connecting an external frontend (like Next.js) to WordPress via REST or GraphQL, ReactWP lets you build directly inside a native WordPress theme. You still benefit from PHP on the server side, as data can be passed directly into your React components without the need for APIs. So instead of writing PHP templates, you're building dynamic React components powered by WordPress data.


# Why ReactWP exists

Most WordPress developers face a tough choice:

- Stick with the outdated PHP/jQuery stack
- Jump into a fully headless setup with Next.js or Gatsby, which is often complex and overkill

ReactWP offers a middle path.
You keep the WordPress ecosystem. You get the React developer experience. You skip the pain of APIs and complex setups.


# Typical use case

Let’s say you’re building a modern marketing site.

You want your frontend to be 100% React. But your client wants to use WordPress to manage the content, menus, and SEO.

With ReactWP:

- You build your interface with React components

- You get data like posts and menus directly inside JS

- You deploy it like any WordPress theme — no Node server or API setup needed


# Who ReactWP is for

- Agencies modernizing old WordPress projects

- Freelancers who prefer React over PHP

- Developers who want React inside WordPress, without headless headaches

- Anyone who wants a clean bridge between modern JS and classic WordPress

# The vision

ReactWP doesn’t try to replace WordPress. It enhances it.

You keep the CMS that works. You use the frontend tools you love. Your clients still get WordPress. Your devs get React. You get a smooth workflow that doesn’t fight the platform.
