ReactWP is a modern boilerplate for building full React-based themes inside WordPress, without going headless.


# Why ReactWP exists

Most WordPress developers face a tough choice:

- Stick with their outdated stack
- Jump into a fully headless setup with Next.js or Gatsby, which is often complex and overkill

ReactWP offers a middle path.

You keep the WordPress ecosystem. You get the React developer experience. You skip the pain of APIs and complex setups.



# The vision

ReactWP doesn’t try to replace WordPress. It enhances it.

You keep the CMS that works. You use the frontend tools you love. Your clients still get WordPress. Your devs get React. You get a smooth workflow that doesn’t fight the platform.
