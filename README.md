ReactWP is a modern boilerplate for building full React-based SPA themes inside WordPress, without going headless.

- GSAP Ready : Play with smooth scroll, loading animations based on media to download, page transition.
- React Helmet Async Ready.


# Why ReactWP exists

Most WordPress developers face a tough choice:

- Stick with their outdated stack
- Jump into a fully headless setup with Next.js or Gatsby, which is often complex and useless

***ReactWP offers a middle path.*** You keep the WordPress ecosystem. You get the React developer experience. You skip the pain of APIs and complex setups.
