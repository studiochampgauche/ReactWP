# ReactWP - Build WordPress Like It's 2025

ReactWP is not for everyone.

It's for advanced developers who want to push WordPress beyond basic blogs and bloated page builders. Whether you're building high-end front-end experiences worthy of Awwwards **or scaling robust plugins and mu-plugins for production use**, ReactWP gives you the structure, performance, and consistency to do it right.

Use modern tools. Write real code. Deliver premium results.

## Why ReactWP?

Because building something custom, clean, fast, and scalable in WordPress shouldn't feel like a hack. ReactWP gives you a modern dev stack, while still respecting what WordPress does best.

### For Themes (React-powered)

- Full React + Webpack setup
- GSAP included for complex animations
- Media-based preloader system
- Media-based page transition system
- Clean integration with WordPress functions
- Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) supported out-of-the-box
- React Helmet Async for SEO control

### For Plugins & MU-Plugins (Standard)

- Structured and boilerplate-ready
- Pure PHP and JS, no React
- Same conventions as the theme side
- Easy to maintain and scale
